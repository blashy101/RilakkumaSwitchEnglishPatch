# RilakkumaSwitchEnglishPatch

Hello, this repo is for an *in progress* English translation patch of "Ouchi de Rilakkuma: Rilakkuma ga Ouchi ni Yatte Kita" aka Rilakkuma at Home. This patch was made for Version 1.02 of the game. I have NOT tested this on unpatched/1.00 so YMMV. Tested on emu/hardware.

Download the latest release zip file and copy the contents to your atmosphere folder.
Folder structure should look like this: SDROOT\atmosphere\contents\010028201240A000\romfs\Data\ *files*

This is an active work in progress. 

As of 3/16/25 the following has not been translated:

All event descriptions (I don't have them unlocked yet and need the context)

All character dialog (appears by their heads), this is in part because it's a large milestone to get to but there is also an issue with English characters I haven't worked out yet. This is a top priority for development. (Get in touch if you're familiar with hacking Unity games and wanna help out please lol)

The "Default settings" button in the music tablet (just cannot find this? will figure it out)

The "Start" button in the minigame selection (see above)



If you find any bugs, feel free to report them, it would be incredibly appreciated.

Special thanks to nave/Becca for the help
