# RilakkumaSwitchEnglishPatch

Hello, this repo is for an *in progress* English translation patch of "Ouchi de Rilakkuma: Rilakkuma ga Ouchi ni Yatte Kita" aka Rilakkuma at Home. This patch was made for Version 1.02 of the game. I have NOT tested this on unpatched/1.00 so YMMV. Tested on emu/hardware.

Download the latest release zip file and copy the contents to your atmosphere folder.
Folder structure should look like this: SDROOT\atmosphere\contents\010028201240A000\romfs\Data\ *files*

This is an active work in progress. 

As of 4/15/25 the following has not been translated:

All event descriptions (I don't have them unlocked yet and need the context)

If you find any bugs, feel free to report them, it would be incredibly appreciated.

Special thanks to nave/Becca for the help
